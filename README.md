NICK ROBERTS
============

I am a full stack software developer with two years experience. After graduating from renowned coding bootcamp Makers Academy, I interned at an art e-commerce business for 3 months, then was employed by a small software company. Both businesses use Ruby on Rails primarily. 

I am a diligent, creative and amiable individual looking to work in a fun organisation with people passionate about what they do. I am looking for opportunities that allow me to continue on a path focused on making robust, high quality software. I particularly enjoy working on front end elements to projects, and get great satisfaction from creating beautiful views that users can navigate with ease. 

I regularly attend meet ups and conferences, and work on side projects outside of work, to help increase my skill set. 

Before retraining, I worked in media sales for 11 years. I have very much enjoyed creating and delivering on specific projects, always working hard to achieve what has been promised. I work well with, and am well liked by, customers and colleagues, the latter I enjoy mentoring and supporting where I can.

Employment and Experience
===============

[**Red56**](http://www.red56.co.uk/)

Software Developer: March 2015 - Present

- Red56 manage software for two customers; an international market research business and a furniture manufacturer. The software we create gives our customers an advantage over their competitors.
- Both apps are built using Ruby on Rails. Both are business focused software, used heavily by a relatively small number of individuals. There is a constant requirement for increasing the capabilities of the software and we are scrupulous when it comes to bugs and performance. Both features and bug fixes are implemented using test driven development. 
- As a team, we work in weekly sprint cycles. Following daily stand ups, we employ a variety of techniques to complete tasks, from solo work (asynchronously and remotely) to pair and mob programming. 
- I have led the implementation of two UI redesigns of our customers' apps. This has made me particularly proficient in HAML, Bootstrap, SASS and jQuery.

Interests
=========

Since learning to code at Makers Academy, programming has been an important part of my life. I regularly attend meet ups and conferences, and work on side projects outside of work, to become a better developer. I have always been a creative individual and am getting a lot of satisfaction from creating small, usable applications.

I have a passion for music. I play guitar and have previously played bass in bands. I currently DJ at a variety of venues in London. I also enjoy writing and have produced podcasts and written for music blogs. 

I very much enjoy reading and have an interest in cultural and current affairs. I love to cook and can turn my hand to dishes from many different national cuisines. My favourites are Italian, Middle Eastern and Mexican. I regularly dine out with my wife or with friends. I also love visiting new countries and cities. 

I regularly give blood and enjoy volunteering, working through Christmas at a Crisis centre in East London. In 2013 I ran the London Marathon, raising over £3000 for Kith and Kids, a charity for people with a learning disability or autism, their parents and siblings.
